<div><h1>Model1 Issues</h1>
<p>
I have 2 problems with my Model 1 mixer, which is still <b>under warranty</b>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="#dsubs">DSUBs inputs thread is stripped</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#filterpop">Filter pop has very audible artifacts</a>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="dsubs">
<h2>DSUBs Inputs</h2>
<p>
The thread on my DSUBs inputs stripped after being used twice. You will see in the video below that when I put the DSUB cable into the 1st input the bolts go in all the way without any resistance. When I put the same cable in the DSUB output, there is resistance & the bolt works as expected (it screws on).
</p>
<p>
I tried this same cable on the DSUBs input of the display unit at SuperBooth 2023 yesterday & it worked as expected. So I know it's not the cable.

<h2>Master Filter Pop/Click</h2>

<p>
I can hear very audible artifacts when toggling the master filter. I know the Model 1 advertises its "zero-crossing detection system", which is meant to minimize artifacts when toggling the channel & master filters.
</p>

<p>
I was told by Allen&Heath support that this does not guarantee the toggling will be completely without artifacts. I've compared my mixer to 2 other Model 1 mixer units & the other two are either completely silent or the artifacts are barely audible (significantly quieter than on mine). I also spoke with one of the Play Differently ambassadors who said that in his experience the master filter toggle is always silent.
</p>

<p>
I would like you to hear how the toggling sounds on my mixer & confirm if you think this is normal (in comparison to ther Model 1 units).
</p>

<p>
In the video below you can hear & see the audible artifacts on mine. The ridge in the spectrogram is the filter toggle.
</p>
<p><u>You need to be listening with headphones or on proper speakers to hear this.</u></p>
<h3>
Instructions to reproduce:
</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Turn on master filter on left side.</li>
	<li>Reduce some of the high frequencies by twisting the LPF knob to the left.</li>
	<li>Toggle the master filter for a specific channel while there is sound going through that channel.</li>
</ol>	

<p>The pop/click is easier to hear when you are playing a bass sound, but you can play any type of sound & still hear it.
